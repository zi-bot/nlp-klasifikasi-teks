The UX team needs to do more research before they roll out another frustrating redesign. Design should make life easier.

It’s pretty useless really. Searching a car part and it shows baby stuff, satellite tracker, and whatever other random stuff having nothing to do with your search. Say you search car part for specific vehicle, it shows a bunch of random parts for other vehicles. Click on one and it says it doesn’t fit your vehicle. OK THEN WHY ARE YOO SHOWING IT TO ME! So dumb.  Especially when you go through the drop downs and have your car specifically put in to search for. My fav, so say searching for a cam for your car, always it says people often bought these together and has the cam you’re looking at plus 2 more cams to two other cars. Like really…. People often buy cams to two others cars or buy 3 cams for the same car together? Total garbage at best',\n",

This also occurs after each time you tap “back”, “return to search”. Then after returning back to previous search page you back at the first page and have to advance back to where you were. This “new” format and layout some times do not have a purchase button and only have a subscription button or neither. It’s to much like a phone app now. I’m sorry but i have a I-Pad, not a I-PHONE I do not want them stupid buttons on the bottom like an I-phone app. Also along the bottom of the window there is a black spot that appear when you first open the app and it also appear to be a notification window but blank. I have tried to tap on it, move it, open it, expand it, but nothing works, it just sits there covering half the screen. Also the right side of page is covered up or running off the edge. You can’t reduce size to make page fit, nor move it over to read it. I have deleted app and reinstalled to try and correct problems, and it may work fine or it may not. When it does load right, the next time I open it’s back to the “I-Phone” format.',\n",

Let’s say you want something made of cotton, so you use the cotton fabric type filter, and results will range from actually being cotton to having absolutely no relevance to cotton. \\n\\nAdditionally, some of the products that actually do fulfill the requirements for the filter actually get filtered out and don’t appear after the filter is applied, thus making the filter pretty useless, for example, we’ll say that you are looking for a dress solid in color, with long bell sleeves. Applying that filter will end up with some with that requirement, but most of the others having short sleeves, patterns, and regular short sleeves. \\n\\nApplying the filter and sorting from cheapest also just doesn’t yield good results, where you can end up with that products that have nothing to do with the search in the top result.

For about the last month I’ve noticed a bug where the pointer will skip to the empty portion of the tab bar to the left of the home tab every time the pointer enters the tab bar. It’s like the location of each item is being mapped to the blank area at the far left, but *only* when navigating with the trackpad. After it initially jumps left when entering the tab bar, I can click in the blank area and will be taken to the cart. If I carefully move the pointer in that blank space, I can find the corresponding spots to click into the other tabs. As soon as I approach the actual location of each item in the tab bar, however, the pointer jumps to the empty space in the far right. It’s impossible to hover the pointer over any of the the actual items in the bar so I have to use my finger on the screen instead. (Trying to use my finger in the blank area that responds to the pointer does nothing until I enter the expected boundary area for the home tab.)',\n",

It’s now Saturday and my package is set to arrive at the campground that I will be leaving on Sunday a day after I leave on Monday. What a hassle. I have to make arrangement s to have the packaged shipped to my house taking more time and money. This is not the first time for being burned on guaranteed 2 day shipping.

       "  'review': \"Three times now I have had a package incorrectly delivered or delayed. One put it in the wrong mailbox, which is crazy because they are all labeled with the building number and letter which is stated in the address line. The second put it on the wrong doorstep and it got stolen. The third, now, is delaying it because I wasn't home despite me asking in the delivery instructions for it to be left on the doorstep. I need the package Monday morning. I imagine it isn't coming, because the driver kept closing the chat before I could respond. I could understand if it was a $50+ package, but it wasn't. And the driver before this one had no issue leaving my $75 package on the wrong doorstep. So one of them clearly isn't following protocol here regarding that if there is a policy about more expensive packages. Like seriously, this is why I canceled my prime subscription and now I'm about to just delete the app as a whole.\",\n",

It is super annoying when you are looking through your wishlist, decide to open something to look at it closer, and then you return to the wish list-where it takes you back to the very top of the list.  It’s irritating, and it makes me give up because I have to start from the beginning and scroll all the way down. So how about you Guys brainstorm, and make app users like me happy and get me back to where I left off on my wish list, instead of me having to start over multiple times and finally giving up because it’s annoying.

Now it’s become dysfunctional and too time consuming to be convenient. Very specific search criteria bring up pages of mixed in products that vary from “product adjacent” to “wt?!!!” If I type in the author and title of a book I want, I expect to see all the options for buying this book first, not 12 pages later giving up cause I’m still seeing 1 option every now and then. Same thing if I search denim shorts women size 6. I don’t think I should be scrolling through baby prams, Halloween costumes for kids or iPhone cases. Nope. I told you what I want.

My searches seem to now show in a grid display instead of my preferred list display and I don’t see any option or toggle to choose the display and switch it back. I prefer the list display because it’s easier and quicker to scroll past listings which are irrelevant to my search…which there are tons that inevitably come up. Just tried to hunt for something specific and had to go through pages and pages of grid listings until frustration took over and I got out. I’ll go back to just using the site instead of the app for most searches. Hopefully, the full site will still display as a list. Disappointing.',\n",

I have the name of the item, who bought it, their address and the tracking number of my refund. They want the tracking number of the purchase. Ha! Apparently I dont see that information. One representative told me to log in with the account of the person who bought it. Sureee, let me ask all my friends for their usernames and passwords.

This is annoying especially for an app not to have options. People that live on the go, don’t want to have to click a next page button for every 15 items displayed. Also seems unfair for the vendors that there’s so few per page displayed. People get frustrated after clicking through I’m guessing a certain number of pages which leaves the rest of the items undiscovered.  \\n\\nThe funny thing is that your home page on the app has infinite scroll with all that random stuff that no one is interested in....😖',\n",

I absolutely hate how crippled the search is. They want to steer you to certain products. You can’t use search tools like dog toys -cat -cats -food to keep the keyword spammers out You can’t filter by same day ship. “Add up to $35 worth” welll it’s real hard to do that when you don’t let us search by that criteria. You get different results depending on the search order. Filter by price-lowest and th search results CHANGE they just aren’t resorted. You can’t use “search only” or a model number. Type a model, the singular, 100% unique, ONLY model number you want and it will throw you a million non related results. You can’t use quotes to restrict a search like “Sony headphones” or will simply show you all headphones. It’s so AGGRAVATING THAT I OFTEN HAVE TO SHOP ON EBAY BECAUSE I CAN’T FIND THE ITEM IN THE WASTELAND OF UNRELATED RESULTS. What I hate the most is KNOWING This is Not a bug, it’s very much on purpose.',\n",

Lately when I search for something I’ve bought it’s no longer at the top of results but gets removed from my list which is inconvenient. Finally the new layout to me is objectively worse for functionality but was pushed through because it looks “nicer” to whoever developed it. It loads slower, less shows up on the screen due to everything being 50% larger for some reason, and has made it slower browsing.
